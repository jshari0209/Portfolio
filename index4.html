      <div class="about1">
         <p>After completing my BSc in Computer Science, I decided to focus on web development through self-learning. Instead of joining a paid course, I’ve been consistently learning through YouTube tutorials, coding challenges, and hands-on practice. This approach has helped me understand real-world skills in a practical and flexible way.</p>

      <div class="about1">
          <p>I’ve spent time improving my front-end development skills—especially HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I regularly watch tech channels, follow structured playlists, and build small projects to apply what I’ve learned. I also practice JavaScript problems to strengthen my logic and problem-solving ability.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="about1">
         <p>I believe that self-learning has made me more independent, disciplined, and curious. I’m excited to grow further in this field and build useful, responsive websites that solve real problems.</p>
